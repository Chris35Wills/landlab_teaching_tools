# landlab_teaching_tools

This repository includes Jupyter Notebooks that implement Landlab for use in teaching undergraduate and graduate courses.

The notebooks illustrate examples of physical processes implemented numerically.

The notebooks are primarily designed for use as homework assignments or laboratory assignments. However, they can be used to illustrate concepts on-the-fly in the classroom.

The notebooks can be run locally by installing Landlab on your computer and downloading this repository onto your computer.

Alternatively, the notebooks can be run remotely on Hydroshare. More information on this later.

Please contact Nicole Gasparini [ngaspari@tulane(dot)edu] for help with using these notebooks or developing new ones. These notebooks will be improved based on your feedback.
