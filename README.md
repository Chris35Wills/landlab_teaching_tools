# Landlab teaching tools :raising_hand:

This repository includes Jupyter Notebooks that implement Landlab for use in teaching undergraduate and graduate courses.

The notebooks illustrate examples of physical processes implemented numerically.

The notebooks are primarily designed for use as homework assignments or laboratory assignments. However, they can be used to illustrate concepts on-the-fly in the classroom.

The notebooks can be run locally by installing Landlab on your computer or they can be run remotely using Hydroshare.

# To install Landlab and run locally: :octocat::computer:

If following this method, every student will need to install Landlab on their personal computer, or it will need to be installed on classroom computers. All software needed to run Landlab locally is opensource (so free!). This link (https://landlab.github.io/#/) will take you to directions on how to install Landlab and information on preferred Python distributions. 

The next step would be for the class instructor to hit the _Clone or download_ button (above, green) and download this repository locally. Choose which Jupyter Notebooks you would like the students to run, and then distribute the notebook to the students. You can edit them to your class needs if you use this method. Note that some notebooks require supporting files to run, so make sure those are copied to the students.

For an introduction to using Jupyter Notebooks, check out this site that has a tutorial using statistics, but a notebook is a notebook! (http://www.randalolson.com/2012/05/12/a-short-demo-on-how-to-use-ipython-notebook-as-a-research-notebook/)

# To use the notebooks on Hydroshare: :umbrella::computer:

These notebooks can all be run remotely using HydroShare, an online collaboration environment for sharing data, models, and code (there are no costs, fees or subscriptions). Using this route, all of your students will need to join HydroShare, and then the notebooks can be run on a super computer elsewhere.

1. Go to https://www.hydroshare.org/
2. Hit blue button _Sign up now_ and follow steps. (remember your user name and password!)
3. Once signed up, on the top bar hit _Collaborate_.
4. Search for the Landlab Group and _Ask to join_
5. Once you have permission, enter the Landlab Group page.
6. Hit the _Resources_ tab.
7. Enter the collection _Landlab\_classroom\_notebooks_
8. Scroll down to _Collection Contents_ and hit on whatever notebook you want to run.
9. Hit the blue _Open with..._ button on the top right, and choose JupyterHub NCSA
10. Scroll down to the first code block, put your cursor in the code block, and hit _shift enter_. Provide your password.
11. Run the next two code blocks. **In this first notebook, you only want to run the first three code blocks!**
12. After the third code block is run, you will get a link to classroom notebook. Hit the link to the classroom notebook. (When this notebook opens, you will be asked to choose a kernal. Python 2 or 3 both work.)
13. Now you are running the notebook remotely!

# More information: :question::open_mouth:

Please contact Nicole Gasparini [ngaspari@tulane(dot)edu] for help with using and improving these notebooks, developing new ones, and solutions to the current notebooks. These notebooks will be improved based on your feedback. I am happy to consult with you on learning the process of running a notebook. It's easy once you learn!
