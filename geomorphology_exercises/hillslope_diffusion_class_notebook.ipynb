    "**What is this notebook?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates the evolution of landforms dominated by processes that result in linear diffusion of sediment. In other words, the downhill flow of soil is proportional to the (downhill) gradient of the land surface multiplied by a transport coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook first illustrates a simple example of a diffusing hillslope. We then provide a number of exercises for students to do on their own. This set of exercises is recomended for students in a quantitative geomorphology class. We assume a basic knowledge of the structure of a Landlab grid, which can be learned from <a href=\"https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/landlab/tutorials/blob/master/grid_object_demo/grid_object_demo.ipynb\">https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/landlab/tutorials/blob/master/grid_object_demo/grid_object_demo.ipynb</a>. However the terms are intuitive and can likely be learned on the fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Application of linear diffusion transport law:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For relatively gentle, soil-mantled slopes, there is reasonably strong support for a transport law of the form:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "q_s = -D \\nabla z\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where ${q}_s$ is the transport rate with dimensions of L$^2$T$^{-1}$;  $D$ is a transport coefficient with dimensions of L$^2$T$^{-1}$; and $z$ is elevation. Using the finite-volume method, we want to calculate ${q_s}$ at each cell face. Suppose node $i$ and node $k$ are neighboring nodes that share a common face (we'll call this face $j$). We approximate the gradient between nodes $i$ and $k$ as:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\nabla z = \\frac{z_i - z_k}{L_{ik}}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $L_{ik}$ is the distance between nodes. On a raster grid, $L_{ik} = \\Delta x$ is simply the grid spacing. (Here we are assuming directionality is from k to i, so $z_k > z_i$.) The sediment flux per unit width is then\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "q_{s_{ik}} \\simeq - D \\frac{z_i - z_k}{L_{ik}}\n",
    "\\end{equation} \n",
    "where $q_{s_{ik}}$ is the volume flux per unit width from node $k$ to node $i$ (if $q_{s_{ik}}$ is negative, sediment flows from $i$ to $k$). To compute the total sediment flux through face $j$, we simply multiply the unit flux by the width of face $j$, which we denote $\\lambda_{ij}$ (read as *the $j$-th face of cell $i$*):\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "Q_{s_{ik}} = q_{s_{ik}} \\lambda_{ij}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "In a regular, raster grid, $\\lambda_{ij} = L_{ik} = \\Delta x$. In the examples here, we apply rock uplift uniformly across the landscape. Changes in elevation, or erosion, are calculated from conservation of mass:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{dz}{dt} = U-\\nabla q_s\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $U$ is the rock uplift rate, with dimensions LT$^{-1}$.\n",

    "**How will we explore this with Landlab?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Landlab has a number of preprogrammed process components for users to explore. One of these process components is the *LinearDiffuser*, which implements the equations above. Here we will explore this on a regular, raster grid. We will explore both steady state, here defined as erosion rate equal to rock uplift rate, and also how a landscape gets to steady state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first example illustrates how to set-up the model and evolve a hillslope to steady state, along with how to plot some variables of interest. We assume that you have knowledge of how to derive the steady-state form of a uniformly uplifting, steady-state, diffusive hillslope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the first example, you are asked to first think about what will happen as you change a parameter, and then you explore this numerically by changing the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start at the top by reading each block of text and sequentially running each code block (shift - enter OR got to the _Cell_ pulldown menu at the top and choose _Run Cells_). \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that you can always go to the _Kernel_ pulldown menu at the top and choose _Restart & Clear Output_ or _Restart & Run All_ if you change things and want to start afresh. If you just change one code block and rerun only that code block, only the parts of the code in that code block will be updated. (E.g. if you change parameters but don't reset the code blocks that initialize run time or topography, then these values will not be reset.) "

Restart everything, and use the model to determine how long it takes for the landscape to go from a flat to reach 50%, 75% and 100% of its steady-state morphology. Does the landscape approach steady state linearly in time? (You can run the time loop (Code Block 9) multiple times without running other code blocks again to continually evolve the landscape. You will initially want to rerun all the code blocks and change the value of **run_time** (Code Block 6). Determining the correct value of **run_time** to use will take some iteration.)\n",

(Make sure you change $D$ back to the original value of 0.01 m$^2$yr$^{-1}$ and restart from a flat surface.) Illustrate the final steady state topography.
