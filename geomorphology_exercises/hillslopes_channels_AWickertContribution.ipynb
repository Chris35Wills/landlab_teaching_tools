    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Here, $K$ are coefficients on the fluvial (_sp_) and hillslope (_hs_) parts of the equation, and $m_{sp}$ and $n_{sp}$ are positive exponents, usually thought to have a ratio, $m_{sp}/n_{sp} \\approx 0.5$. $A$ is drainage area and $S$ is the slope of steepest descent ($-\\frac{dz}{dx}$) where $x$ is horizontal distance (positive in the downslope direction) and $z$ is elevation. (If slope is negative there is no fluvial erosion.) $U$ is an externally-applied uplift field.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first term on the right hand side of the equation is the fluvial erosion term, which is also known as the stream power equation. The second term on the right hand side of the equation is elevation changes via linear diffusion, and linear diffusion is one way in which to describe hillslope sediment transport.\n",

If you just change one code block and rerun only that code block, only the parts of the code in that code block will be updated.

(Download or screenshoot the figures.) You may want to make other plots with the data you collect using this model. You are free to make those plots using whatever software you choose.\n",
    "\n",
    "In parts of this exercise you need to work with your classmates. You are encouraged to discuss how to use the model and model results with your classmates, however the write-up that you hand in must be your own work.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hillslope vs. Fluvial Processes. ** Using the parameters provided in the initial notebook, run the landscape to steady state, or the point at which the topography and the slope-area relationship stop changing (i.e. erosion equals rock uplift). (You can keep rerunning Code Block 7 until steady state is reached.) Use the plots of slope and area to estimate where the hillslope–fluvial transition is (or in otherwords, the threshold drainage area for channel heads). Now try keeping $K_{sp}$ the same but increase and decrease $K_{hs}$ (in Code Block 2). How does the transition from hillslope to channel change with changes in $K_{hs}$? Now try keeping $K_{hs}$ the same but increase and decrease $K_{sp}$ (in Code Block 2). How does the transition from hillslope to channel change with changes in $K_{sp}$? Produce a relationship between the different values of $K_{sp}$, $K_{hs}$ and the threshold drainage area. Remember to run all of your different parameter values to steady state before estimating the threshold drainage area.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Uplift and erosion. ** Now, perform a similar set of exercises as you did in exercise 1, but also systematically vary uplift rate. Work in teams, and each person should choose two combinations of $K_{sp}$ and $K_{hs}$ and three uplift rates (for a total of 6 runs). Make sure the values that you choose do not overlap with your group members. This time make sure you document the transition from hillslope to fluvial process, and you also note the maximum steady state elevation for each combination of uplift, $K_{sp}$ and $K_{hs}$. Produce relationships to show how the threshold and maximum elevation change with the different variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ** Landscapes evolving to steady state. ** Try changing the grid size. Keep running the model until it reaches steady state. Keep record of this time. Now trying changing the rock uplift rate and record the time to steady state. Change the resolution (i.e. the cell size, Code Block 2) and record the time to steady state. Combine in groups to gather enough model outputs to form relationships between time to steady state and grid size, resolution, or  rock uplift rate. After doing this, choose a constant model set-up (fix grid size, resolution, and uplift rate) and run the model from a flat initial condition with noise to steady state, but capture snapshots of the topography and slope-area relationship as the landscape evolves. Now try changing one of the variables (grid size, resolution, or rock uplift rate) and do the same thing. Note any qualitative or quantitative differences you see (or do not see) between these two different evolutionary sequences.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. ** Free-form exploration. ** Try changing the grid type (Code Block 3), grid size (Code Block 2), stream power exponents (Code Block 2), distribution of uplift rate (e.g., what happens if you have just part of the landscape experience uplift, a bit trickier, as uplift in Code Block 2 will need to be changed to an array), etc. Based on what you observe, create a consistent geomorphic history of the system. Creativity is expected here!"
