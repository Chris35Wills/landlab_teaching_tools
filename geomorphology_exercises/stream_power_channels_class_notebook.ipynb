    "This notebook illustrates the evolution of detachment-limited channels in an actively uplifting landscape. The landscape evolves according to the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    " \\frac{d z}{d t} = -K_\\text{sp} A^{m_{sp}} S^{n_{sp}} + U\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Here, $K_{sp}$ is the coefficient on fluvial incision, and $m_{sp}$ and $n_{sp}$ are positive exponents, usually thought to have a ratio, $m_{sp}/n_{sp} \\approx 0.5$. $A$ is drainage area and $S$ is the slope of steepest descent ($-\\frac{dz}{dx}$) where $x$ is horizontal distance (positive in the downslope direction) and $z$ is elevation. (If slope is negative there is no fluvial erosion.) $U$ is an externally-applied rock uplift field.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fluvial erosion term is also known as the stream power equation. Before using this notebook you should be familiar with this equation from class lectures and reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "** What will you do? **\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will modify the code to get a better understanding of how rock uplift and erodibility control fluvial channel form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start at the top by reading each block of text and sequentially running each code block (shift - enter OR got to the _Cell_ pulldown menu at the top and choose _Run Cells_). \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that you can always go to the _Kernel_ pulldown menu at the top and choose _Restart & Clear Output_ or _Restart & Run All_ if you change things and want to start afresh. If you just change one code block and rerun only that code block, only the parts of the code in that code block will be updated. (E.g. if you change parameters but don't reset the code blocks that initialize run time or topography, then these values will not be reset.) \n",
    "\n",
    "** Questions to answer before starting this assignment. **\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer these questions before running the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What do you think will happen to total relief and channel slope at steady state if $K_{sp}$ is uniformly increased?\n",
    "2. What do you think will happen to total relief and channel slope at steady state if $U$ is uniformly increased?\n",
    "3. How do you think a steady-state landscape with a uniform low rock uplift rate will respond if rock uplift is uniformly increased? How will channel slopes change through time?"

Anything with a question mark should be answered in the document that you hand in. \n",

(Note that you can keep running the main evolution loop - Code Block 7 - and the different plotting blocks without running the code blocks above them.) How did you know that the landscape reached steady state? Note the approximate time that it took to reach steady state. Include appropriate plots. (If you want to analyze these landscapes outside of Landlab or save for later, make sure you save the elevation data to a text file (Code Block 13).)\n",

Before running this, make sure that you also reduce _tmax_ to 1e5 yrs (Code Block 4). Run this until the maximum elevation in the grid is ~ 170 m and observe how the landscape gets to this elevation. What patterns do you see in the supporting plots that illustrate this type of transient? Which patterns, if any, are diagnostic of a landscape response to uniform increase in rock uplift rate? (You may need to answer this after completing all of the questions.)\n",

Run for 1e5 yrs and save the plots that you think are diagnostic. Run for another 1e5 yrs and save plots again. Now run for 5e5 yrs and save plots of the topography and slope-area relationship. Quantitatively describe how the landscape evolves in response to the increase in erodibility and provide supporting plots. What could cause a uniform increase in erodibility?\n",

Now add a seismic event - a fault that runs horizontally across the landscape at y = 4000 m, and instantaneously uplifts half the landscape by 10 meters (Code Block 6). In this case, we will keep background uplift uniform. Set tmax to 1e5 yrs (Code Block 4). Now run the time loop four times and look at the different plots after each loop. How does the landscape respond to this fault? What patterns do you see in the supporting plots that illustrate this type of transient?

Now we will add a fault (at y = 4000 m) in which the uplift rate on the footwall is higher (0.0004 m/yr) than on the hanging wall (uplift rate = 0.0001 m/yr). (Edit Code Block 6.) Set tmax to 1e5 yrs (Code Block 4) before you start running the time loop. Now run the time loop four separate times and look at the different plots after each loop. How does the landscape respond to this fault? What patterns do you see in the supporting plots that illustrate this type of transient?

Now we will add a linear gradient in uplift rate across the entire range (edit Code Block 6). The maximum uplift rate will be 0.0004 m/yr at the core of the range, and 0.0001 m/yr at the front of the range. Set tmax to 1e5 yrs (Code Block 4) before you start running the time loop. Now run the time loop four separate times and look at the different plots after each loop. How does the landscape respond to this gradient in uplift rate?
