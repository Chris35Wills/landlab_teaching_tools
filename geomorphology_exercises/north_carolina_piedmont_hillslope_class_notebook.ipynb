    "**What is this notebook?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to be an exercise for students in a quantative geomorphology class. This notebook is meant to illustrate to students how a model can be used to understand and interpret real landscapes. This notebook is not designed to teach students how to code, nor is it designed to teach students how to use Landlab.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides data from a real landscape in North Carolina in order to compare the shape of this hillslope with those produced by models using linear diffusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook steps students through exercises to quantify the diffusivity on this hillslope, assuming that sediment transport on this hillslope follows a linear diffusion law. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Application of linear diffusion transport law:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The tranport law applied here is of the form:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "q_s = -D \\nabla z\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where ${q}_s$ is the transport rate with dimensions of L$^2$T$^{-1}$;  $D$ is a transport coefficient with dimensions of L$^2$T$^{-1}$; and $z$ is elevation. $\\nabla z$ is the gradient in the landscape, and landscape slope is $-\\nabla z$, hence the negative in the above equation. \n",
    " \n",
    "Changes in elevation, or erosion, are calculated from conservation of mass:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{dz}{dt} = U-\\nabla q_s\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $U$ is the rock uplift rate, with dimensions LT$^{-1}$ and $t$ is time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that at steady state the rock uplift rate sets the erosion rate. If the erosion rate in a landscape is a known, a modeling scenario in which the landscape is uplifting at the same rate as the known erosion rate will eventually lead to a landscape that is also eroding at that rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "**What will we do with Landlab?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will use the Landlab component *LinearDiffuser*, to explore whether hillslopes evolved according to a linear diffusion rule look like the example North Carolina hillslope. We will just be eye-balling similarities. No rigorous comparison between the real and modeled hillslope is performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "More general background on applying hillslope process models to real landscapescan be found in this paper:\n",

    "\n",
    "For now the following information is provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The site is in the Piedmont near Raleigh, North Carolina.\n",
    "- The site is in the W.B. Umstead State Park which is in the Sycamore Creek watershed. Sycamore Creek drains into the Neuse River.\n",
    "- The area gets ~ 1.25 m/yr of rainfall.\n",
    "- The site is currently forested.\n",
    "- Basin average erosion rates from the area are on the order of 10 m/million years, or 1e-5 m/yr. These rates are averaged over millenial time scales. These rates are from a nearby area similar to this, but not exactly this study area.\n",
    "- The site has been heavily impacted from agriculture due to European settlers, beginning in the 1600s. \n",
    "\n",
    "**What you need to do:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You will start out by making the assumption that the landscape is eroding at a rate of 1e-5 m/yr. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you will see, the study area hillslope profile has a form similar to what one would expect from a uniformly eroding diffusive profile. **Your first goal is to find the diffusivity and time required for the profile to reach steady state given the background erosion rate of 1e-5 m/yr.** You can do that by running the code below. **Take special note of Code Block 6 where you set the diffusivity. Make sure choose a resonable initial value, and record what your initial value was.** Also be prepared to change model run time (Code Block 7) for your initial experiments. Once you iterate to a modeled profile that you feel reasonably matches the DEM profile (just eye-ball the similarity), you will be ready to answer the questions that follow all of the code. \n",

    "Remember that you can always go to the _Kernel_ pulldown menu at the top and choose _Restart & Clear Output_ or _Restart & Run All_ if you change things and want to start afresh. If you just change one code block and rerun only that code block, only the parts of the code in that code block will be updated.

    "1. Your first task was to find the diffusivity and time to steady state required for the model to produce a landscape similar to the field area near Raleigh, NC. (Time to steady state can be approximate, you don't have to hone in on the exact year. I am just looking for order of magnitude time.) What was your initial guess for a diffusivity? What information did you use to choose that initial value? What was the value that produced a good match between the modeled and real hillslope form? (Again, you can eye-ball the match. Just get close visually.) Compared with other values of diffusivity that have been reported in the literature, how does your value compare? That is, given what you know about this landscape, does this seem like a reasonable diffusivity? Explain.\n",
    "2. What was the estimated time to steady state using the model? Compare the time to steady state with the time over which erosion rates were measured and the time period over which humans have dramatically impacted this landscape. What are the implications of the differences among the time to steady state, the time over which erosion rates were measured, and time over which humans have impacted this system?\n",
    "3. It is possible that humans accelerated erosion rates (from the background, pre-settlement rate, which here we can assume is set from \"background rock uplift\") by almost 500 times. If that happened, how would the profile of today be different from the pre-settlement profile (~400 years ago)? Does this have any implications for your estimated diffusivity? What would you need to change in the model to \"simulate\" this? Develop a scenario in which you evolve a landscape to steady state, then you change some parameters, and then evolve the landscape another 400 years to simulate the impact of humans. Provide plots and describe in detail exactly what you did to simulate the pre- and post-human landscape. Are there noticeable changes in the landscape? "
