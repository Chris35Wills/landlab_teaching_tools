    "**What is this notebook?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates the evolution of landforms dominated by processes that result in linear diffusion of sediment. In other words, the downhill flow of soil is proportional to the (downhill) gradient of the land surface multiplied by a transport coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook first illustrates a simple example of a diffusing hillslope. We then provide a number of exercises for you to do on your own. This set of exercises is recomended for students in a quantitative geomorphology class. Just in case, we provide a bit of background on linear diffusion here. We assume a basic knowledge of the structure of a Landlab grid, which can be learned from <a href=\"https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/landlab/tutorials/blob/master/grid_object_demo/grid_object_demo.ipynb\">https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/landlab/tutorials/blob/master/grid_object_demo/grid_object_demo.ipynb</a>. However the terms are intuitive and can likely be learned on the fly.\n",

    "(Note this is adapted from *Landscape Evolution Modeling with CHILD* by Gregory Tucker and Stephen Lancaster.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For relatively gentle, soil-mantled slopes, there is reasonably strong support for a transport law of the form:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "q_s = -D \\nabla z\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $\\vec{q}_s$ is the transport rate with dimensions of L$^2$T$^{-1}$;  $D$ is a transport coefficient with dimensions of L$^2$T$^{-1}$; and $z$ is elevation. Using the finite-volume method, we want to calculate $\\vec{q_s}$ at each cell face. Suppose node $i$ and node $k$ are neighboring nodes that share a common face (we'll call this face $j$). We approximate the gradient between nodes $i$ and $k$ as:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\nabla z = \\frac{z_k - z_i}{L_{ik}}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",

    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "q_{sik} \\simeq - D \\frac{z_k - z_i}{L_{ik}}\n",
    "\\end{equation} \n",
    "where $q_{sik}$ is the volume flux per unit width from node $k$ to node $i$ (if $q_{sik}$ is negative, sediment flows from $k$ to $i$). To compute the total sediment flux through face $j$, we simply multiply the unit flux by the width of face $j$, which we denote $\\lambda_{ij}$ (read as *the $j$-th face of cell $i$*):\n",

    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{dz}{dt} = U-\\nabla q_s\n",

Here we will explore this on a regular, raster grid. We will explore both steady state, here defined as erosion rate equal to rock uplift rate, and also how a landscape gets to steady state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first example illustrates how to set-up the model and evolve a hillslope to steady state, along with how to plot some variables of interest. We assume that you have knowledge of how to derive the steady-state form of a uniformly uplifting, steady-state, diffusive hillslope.\n",
